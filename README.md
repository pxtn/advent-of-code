# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

## How to run

Run with Node.js:

```bash
node 2020/day_01/part_1.js
```

The following output should be printed:

```
★ ================================ ★
‖                                  ‖
‖  Output value   : *no spoilers*  ‖
‖  Finished after : 0.463 ms       ‖
‖                                  ‖
★ ================================ ★
```
